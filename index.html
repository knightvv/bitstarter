	 <p> Imagine if a streetlamp knew you were coming. It could announce your arrival from a distance. If you were on a date, it could help set the mood. It could ring in the new year with dazzling effects, change color at will, even announce days in advance when its bulb was set to blow.
	   In fact, there is nothing future-tense about this fantastical vision; in a handful of municipalities in Europe, streetlights have become downright chatty.
	   The system is called Tvilight. It was invented by Dutch designer Chintan Shah while a student at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. When flying overseas, he noticed streetlamps lighting streets that, in the middle of the night, were empty and desolate.
	   "I started researching," he says. "I wondered, why are they burning? How much does it cost? Is this a problem? I discovered some amazing numbers."

	   Certainly the team will be different to our last game. I'm used to resolving my own problems without looking at theirs. We certainly cannot base ourselves on our opponents because we'd be beaten before we start. We have a precise identity and we'll play the way we know how to play. If in the end they are better than us, I'll pay my compliments, but certainly until the very last minute has been played, none of us will feel beaten.
	   
	   There were two reasons I made changes to my team to face Sweden. One, to give some girls a rest as it would have been three games in a week, but, above all, to give the chance to some of the girls who have played less to get the experience of playing in a EURO and show their qualities. We are not 11 first teamers and 11 reserves. Apart from the first ten minutes of the second half, above all the first half and the last 20 minutes, we did well and never had problems, so I'm happy with those who have played less.
	   
	   There's not one German player to pick out in particular. Of course, the Germany side, given their results in previous tournaments, are a side to respect and they have a great tradition. We will face them trying to impose our own game, which can cause problems to anybody.
	   
	   Exactly 31 years have passed [since Cabrini won the 1982 FIFA World Cup for Italy against West Germany], football was different then, so it has no relation to this game tomorrow. Games between Italy and Germany have always been very passionate affairs and there has always been a great deal of interest in them.
